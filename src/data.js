Align yourself so where the box is flush with the corner of the wall in the 1st image (same as stair side dart). Then shoot right above the black spec on the wall on the 2nd picture. Very good dart that reveals the slow pushers. Mix this dart up with the stair side dart so it doesn't always get shot. You can aim higher on the wall, and the dart will end up on the doorway instead of the ground. There's a wire on the wall, make sure you don't hit the wire on the first bounce. ",

You can try to align yourself with the yellow spots on the image below, but it's still very difficul for me. It lands in the best spot on B, with almost not detection until it's too late. I won't even bother explaining how to do this one because I can't even consistently replicate it. But this dart with 2 brim smokes on either side of the metal container is a free entrance to B.
